# Hangman
This Java program implements the classic Hangman game, where players guess letters or the entire word within a limited number of strikes. The game prompts users to input a word for their opponent, validates the input, and then challenges them to guess the hidden word. The code leverages arrays and loops, providing an interactive experience with a simple console interface.
